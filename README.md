This year marks the 100th anniversary of the declaration of World War 1, also known as *The Great War*.  The war began on the 28th of July 1914.  To commemorate this event we've come up with a way for you to replicate and play with the main form of radio communication that was around back then ago using your Raspberry Pi.

## Lesson objectives

- Understand what Morse Code is
- Understand how Morse was used for communication
- Understand how to send and receive Morse
- Understand a pull up circuit
- Understand a pull down circuit

## Lesson outcomes

- To have programmed the Raspberry Pi to create Morse Code tones
- To have sent and recieved messages in Morse Code
- Gained experience in Python programming
- Gained experience using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins

## Requirements

As well as your Raspberry Pi and all its standard peripherals, you'll need:

### Hardware

### Software

### Time required

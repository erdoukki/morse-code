This year marks the 100th anniversary of the declaration of [World War 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), also known as *The Great War*.  The war began on the 28th of July 1914.  To commemorate this event we've come up with a way for you to simulate and experience the main form of radio communication that was used back then.

## Lesson objectives

- Understand what Morse Code is
- Understand how Morse was used for communication
- Understand how to send and receive Morse
- Understand a pull up circuit
- Understand a pull down circuit

## Lesson outcomes

- To have programmed the Raspberry Pi to create Morse Code tones
- To have sent and recieved messages in Morse Code
- Gained experience in Python programming
- Gained experience using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi
- Micro USB power adaptor
- An SD Card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- USB mouse
- HDMI cable
- Ethernet cable
- LAN with Internet connection
- A monitor or TV
- **Male** to **Female** jumper wires, at least 2 (try [Pimoroni](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jumper-jerky))

### Software

- python-pygame

### Extras

- A Morse Code key (try [nevada radio](http://www.nevadaradio.co.uk/amateur-radio/morse-keys/mfj-550))

  A real Morse Code key will bring this project to life. Especially if you can acquire an antique one. These can often be found in local antique shops all over the country. Alternatively you can also buy one online, see the link above.

## Introduction: what is Morse Code?

![](./images/qst_may_1942.png)

Invented by [Samuel Morse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_F._B._Morse) in the year 1836, Morse Code is a method for sending and receiving text messages using short and long beeps. Conventionally a short beep is called a *dot* and a long one is a *dash* (also known as a *dit* and a *dah*). Every letter of the alphabet has a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

If you look at the chart below, the letter **A** is beep beeeeeep.

The letter **B** is beeeeeep beep beep beep.

- A dash is three times the length of a dot
- Each dot or dash has a short gap of silence after it
- Letters in a word have a slightly longer gap of silence between them
- Words have an even longer gap of silence between them

You don't necessarily need to use sound for this, although this is the most common way Morse Code was used. You can do it with anything that can be turned on and off. You could use a torch, raising and lowering a flag or even just blink your eyes fast and slow. This makes it one of the most versatile forms of telecommunication. There is even a formal international treaty which enshrines the Morse code for SOS `... --- ...` (Save Our Souls) as a universal distress signal.

In the 1890's morse code was adapted for use with early [radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_communication) before it was possible to send and recieve voice. It was done by simply sending pulses of a carrier wave at an agreed frequency. The recipients radio would then just play an audible tone whenever the carrier was received. It was used extensively during both World Wars and is still used to this day by amateur radio operators. Morse is also sometimes referred to colloquially as CW meaning *carrier wave*.

So there are three aspects to Morse
  - Knowing the code
  - Being able to key it in
  - Being able to decode it when listening

## Introduction: what is Morse Code?

Morse Code is a method for sending and receiving text messages using short and long beeps or tones. Conventionally a short tone is called a *dot* and a long one is a *dash* (also known as a *dit* and a *dah*). Every letter of the alphabet has a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

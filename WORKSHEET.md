## Introduction: what is Morse Code?

Invented by [Samuel Morse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_F._B._Morse) in the year 1836, Morse Code is a method for sending and receiving text messages using short and long beeps. Conventionally a short beep is called a *dot* and a long one is a *dash* (also known as a *dit* and a *dah*). Every letter of the alphabet has a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

- A dash is three times as long as a dot
- Each dot or dash has a short gap of silence after it
- Letters in a word have a slightly longer short gap of silence between them
- Words have an even longer gap of silence between them

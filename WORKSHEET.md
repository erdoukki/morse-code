## Introduction: what is Morse Code?

Invented by [Samuel Morse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_F._B._Morse) in the year 1836, Morse Code is a method for sending and receiving text messages using short and long beeps. Conventionally a short beep is called a *dot* and a long one is a *dash* (also known as a *dit* and a *dah*). Every letter of the alphabet has a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

If you look at the chart below, the letter **A** is beep beeeeeep.

The letter **B** is beeeeeep beep beep beep.

- A dash is three times the length of a dot
- Each dot or dash has a short gap of silence after it
- Letters in a word have a slightly longer short gap of silence between them
- Words have an even longer gap of silence between them

You don't necessarily need to use beeps for this, although this is the most common way for Morse Code. You can do it with anything that can be turned on and off. You could use a torch, flash an LED or even just blink your eyes fast and slow.
